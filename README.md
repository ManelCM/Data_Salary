# Analysis of a "Salary Prediction" Free Dataset

## Abstract
This analysis explores a "Salary Prediction" dataset to understand the factors influencing salary and develop a predictive model. Using a combination of parametric and non-parametric bootstrap methods, we examine the data, draw conclusions, and discuss the implications for salary prediction.

## 1. Introduction
The primary goal of this analysis is to predict salary based on a given dataset. Understanding the factors affecting salary can be valuable for both employees and employers. We aim to create an accurate salary prediction model and provide insights into the significance of various features.

## 2. Dataset Description
The "Salary Prediction" dataset used in this analysis is freely available and is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023]. It contains information about individuals' salaries and relevant features such as education, years of experience, location, and more.

## 3. Data Analysis Techniques
To analyze the dataset, we employ a combination of parametric and non-parametric bootstrap methods. These statistical techniques allow us to estimate the population parameters and make inferences about the dataset. Parametric bootstrapping assumes a specific distribution, while non-parametric bootstrapping does not rely on distribution assumptions, making the analysis robust.
